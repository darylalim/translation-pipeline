"""Live end-to-end check against the real model.

Deselected by default (`-m "not live"` in `addopts`) because it loads the full
3.9 GB quant and runs real inference. Run it with `uv run pytest -m live`.

Every other test replaces `mlx_lm` with a `MagicMock`, so the suite cannot see
runtime breakage in the MLX stack: an `mlx-lm`/`mlx` pairing that returns an
empty translation still passes all 87 mocked tests at 100% coverage. This is
the only test that would notice, which makes it worth running by hand after
any `mlx` or `mlx-lm` bump. See Known Issues in CLAUDE.md for the failure that
prompted it.
